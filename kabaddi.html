	<p>The craze for kabaddi rocketed up in the last few years everywhere as the Pro Kabaddi League started and people got teams of their state. The game of Kabaddi involves two teams who defend themselves from a raider from the opposite team. The game has now risen to international recognition. Here are some sample essays on kabaddi.</p>

<p>Kabaddi is a game of two different teams, each team containing seven players. One player is known as a"raider”, and raids into other teams' half courts and tries to touch as many players as they can while continuously chanting "kabaddi” in a single breath.</p>

<p>Kabaddi is one of the most famous sports in the Indian subcontinent and other neighbouring countries with different regional names. Kabaddi has two different variations, namely “standard style” and “circle style”.</p>

<p>Kabaddi is the national sport of Bangladesh. It is the state game of different states in India like Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Odisha. It is a highly regarded game in Nepal, taught and played in primary schools. It is also the country’s national sport.</p>

<p>Kabaddi is a contact team sport. There are two teams of seven players each, who defend their courts from an offending player, trying to touch as many of the defending players as possible in a single breath. The raider team gets a point for every player their player touches from the opposite team and thereby eliminates them from the game. The defending team gets a point for the successful capture of a raider. Players are taken back into the game for each point scored by the team. This cycle of defending and raiding continues till there's no one left in a team.</p>

<p><b>Different Names Of Kabaddi </b>| Kabaddi has different names in various regions. It is known as “hu-tu-tu” in the western region, “hu-do-do” in the eastern region, and “chadakudu” in the southern region of the Indian subcontinent. It is known as “ha-du-du” in Bangladesh and “kapardi” in Nepal.</p>

<p><b>Styles Of Kabaddi</b> | Kabaddi has two different styles of playing depending on the shape of the ground. "Circle Style”, also known as "Punjabi Kabaddi” is a traditional form of Kabaddi played on a circle-shaped ground, and is most famous in rural areas of Punjab, that is, where it originated from. “Standard Style” is played in a rectangular-shaped court, and is widely played including that in various national and international competitions, such as the Asian games.</p>

<p>The origin of Kabaddi goes back to ancient India. It is mentioned in the Sangam literature that Sadugudu (older name for Kabaddi) was practised for ages and was used as a warm-up sport before playing Jallikattu. Another form of this sport originated in Tamil Nadu 4,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Kabaddi was famous among the Yadava people. An Abhang by Tukaram states that Lord Krishna used to play Kabaddi in his childhood.</p>

<p><b>Kabaddi As A Competitive Sport </b>| India first popularised Kabaddi as a competitive sport, with the first competitions organised in the late 1920s. The All India Kabaddi Federation was formed in 1950. Kabaddi was played as a demonstration sport during the first Asian games in 1951 in Delhi, and made a part of Asian games in 1990.</p>

<h5>Rules of Kabaddi</h5>
<p>There are different variations of Kabaddi but the basic rules of scoring a point, number of players, and declaring someone out are mostly the same. Let's take a look at the basic rules of Kabaddi.</p>

<p>Each team consists of 12 players from which only 7 players will be on the court at a time and others will be substitutes.</p>

<p>Matches are categorised according to the age and weight of players because of the physical nature of this contact sport.</p>

<p>Each game is played in two halves of 20 minutes with a 5-minute break at halftime.</p>

<p>A raider gets a point for every player of the other team he touches in a single breath. The defending team gets a point for the successful capture of a raider.</p>

<p>Players that are declared ‘out’ while raiding or defending can be taken in with each point scored.</p>

<p>Each team takes turns raiding and defending. The courts are switched after the halftime break.</p>

<p>The game in the same manner continues till the time up. The team that scores the maximum points is declared winner.</p>

<h5>Coming of The Pro Kabaddi League</h5>
<p>In a country dominated by cricket, the beginning of the Pro-Kabaddi League in 2014 glamorised the sport of Kabaddi in India, and it became the second most–watched sport event after the Indian Premier League. It helped many players from rural India to show their talent at the game at the national and international levels. Kabaddi getting recognised at a bigger level has fetched livelihood and a means of sustenance for many of those skilled at the game.</p>

<p>When I was in school, we used to play Kabaddi just as a pastime and because our seniors usually kept the cricket bat and ball with themselves. Unlike for other sports like cricket, football, and basketball, there weren't many competitions organised for Kabaddi despite there being some talented players around. However, with the beginning of the Pro-Kabaddi League, things have changed. My peers from school who have been good at Kabaddi right from school days are now playing in various tournaments organised by universities and state federations.</p>

<p>Good performance in Kabaddi is even fetching scholarships to these students. Now, I am in college in the capital of my state, and the players who played kabaddi with me in school are playing in various tournaments held by universities and state federations. Some players are even getting scholarships based on the amazing skills that they achieved playing kabaddi during school just to pass time.</p>
